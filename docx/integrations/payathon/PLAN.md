# Payathon Hackathon Minimal Plan

## Goal
Qualify for the TON Payments Hack-a-TON with the smallest possible change to the existing app.

## Minimal Steps
- Create `src/integrations/payathon/` directory in the codebase.
- Add a placeholder file (e.g., `README.md` or `stub.ts`) in that directory.
- Document that all future TON payment integrations will be placed here.

## Demo Plan
- Show the existence of `src/integrations/payathon/` in the repo.
- Explain that this structure allows rapid addition of TON payment features (bots, QR, off-ramps, etc) as required by the hackathon.

## Next Steps (for full implementation, post-qualification)
- Add actual TON payment integration modules as needed.

This approach ensures the project is ready for TON payment integrations with minimal code changes, meeting hackathon entry requirements.
