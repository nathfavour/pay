# Payathon Integrations

This directory is reserved for all TON Payments Hack-a-TON integrations.

- Add new TON payment modules, bots, or utilities here.
- Keeps hackathon code modular and isolated from existing app logic.

## Example
To add a new integration, create a file in this directory (e.g., `qrPayment.ts`, `telegramBot.ts`).

This file is a placeholder to qualify for the hackathon and does not affect any existing functionality.
